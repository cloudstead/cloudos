Your very own private cloud.

## Developing on CloudOs

Here's how to [set up a fresh development environment](docs/developing.md), run tests, 
and build your own CloudOs, straight from the source code.

Interested in some code that's a little less raw, and a little more fully-baked? Read on for the quick setup. 

## Basics

So you want to launch a CloudOs instance? Excellent. The high-level steps are:
* Have a CloudOs distribution ready to deploy
* Configuration
* Prepare a deploy target (machine or VM)
* Deploy CloudOs to target

Here we go...

## Get the code

    git clone https://github.com/cloudstead/cloudos-dist.git # get the code
    cd cloudos

If you want to run the tests, follow the steps to [set up a full development environment](docs/developing.md)

## Configuration
